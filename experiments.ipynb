      "Question: Is it legal to protest in public in India?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Yes, it is legal to protest in public in India. Citizens have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms, as enshrined in Article 19(1)(b) of the Constitution of India. This right is consistent with the principles of a constitutional democracy, where citizens can express their views and grievances concerning government policies and actions. However, this right may be subject to reasonable restrictions as specified in Article 19(2), which outlines the grounds on which such restrictions can be imposed.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are my rights if I am arrested in India?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "If you are arrested in India, your rights include the following, as outlined in Article 22 of the Constitution of India:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Right to be Informed**: You have the right to be informed at the time of arrest of the reasons for your arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Right to Legal Counsel**: You have the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of your choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Right to be Produced Before a Magistrate**: According to Article 22(2), every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest, excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate. You cannot be detained in custody beyond this period without the authority of a magistrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Preventive Detention Exceptions**: If you are arrested under a law providing for preventive detention, special rules apply. Article 22(3) states that the aforementioned rights do not apply to any person who is an enemy alien or to those arrested under preventive detention laws. However, such detention cannot exceed three months unless an Advisory Board has reported that there is sufficient cause for further detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rights are fundamental and ensure that individuals are protected against arbitrary arrest and detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Can the government restrict freedom of speech in India?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Yes, the government can impose restrictions on freedom of speech in India, but such restrictions must fall within the framework established by Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India. According to this article, reasonable restrictions can be placed on the freedom of speech and expression in the interests of:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Sovereignty and integrity of India\n",
      "- Security of the State\n",
      "- Friendly relations with foreign States\n",
      "- Public order\n",
      "- Decency or morality\n",
      "- Contempt of Court\n",
      "- Defamation\n",
      "- Incitement to an offence\n",
      "\n",
      "However, as noted in the judgments of Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras and Brij Bhushan v. The State of Delhi, the Supreme Court has clarified that there cannot be any restrictions on freedom of speech and expression beyond those explicitly mentioned in Article 19(2). Therefore, any interference with this freedom in the name of public interest is not permissible unless it aligns with the specified restrictions.\n",

      "Question: What is the legal age of marriage in India?\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      "I don't know.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What are the laws regarding property inheritance in India?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "The laws regarding property inheritance in India are primarily governed by personal law, as referenced in the Constitution of India under the Seventh Schedule, specifically under item 5. This includes matters related to \"wills, intestacy and succession\" as well as \"joint family and partition.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Each religious community in India has its own personal laws that dictate the rules of inheritance, such as Hindu Succession Act for Hindus, Muslim Personal Law for Muslims, and various other acts for Christians and others. These laws encompass the rights of individuals to inherit property, the distribution of property upon death (intestate or by will), and the rules surrounding joint family property and partition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, property inheritance in India is subject to the personal laws of the individuals involved, as stated in Article 322 (5) of the Constitution of India.\n",
